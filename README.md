# tech-blog

## Description
In this project I developed a tech-blog. You can create a log-in and post tech related posts using handlebars. I found this project especially difficult to work with handlebars.

## Installation 
You will need to install the following dependencies.


## Usage
You must create a log-in. Once you do you can go to the dashboard and create a new post.
You can click on existing posts and see the comments already made on them or create a comment of your own.

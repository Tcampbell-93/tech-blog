# tech-blog

## Description
In this project I developed a tech-blog. You can create a log-in and post tech related posts using handlebars. I found this project especially difficult to work with handlebars. I learned a lot about working with the MVC framework.

## Installation 
You will need to install the following dependencies.
    "bcrypt": "^5.0.0",
    "connect-session-sequelize": "^7.0.4",
    "dotenv": "^8.2.0",
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "express-handlebars": "^5.2.0",
    "express-session": "^1.17.1",
    "mysql2": "^2.2.5",
    "sequelize": "^6.3.5"


## Usage
You must create a log-in. Once you do you can go to the dashboard and create a new post.
You can click on existing posts and see the comments already made on them or create a comment of your own. Or you can update the post.
